    What is This?

      SchoolTool has a set of built-in "membership states," which
      define basic types of relationships between people and between
      people and groups. For each relationship, there is a limited set
      of "meanings," and the school can add custom states that act as
      specific codes for local use.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      For example, in the Student Enrollment relationship, a school
      could create both "Dropped out" and "Transferred". From the
      system's point of view, the "meaning" of both would be set to
      "Inactive", and the two states are treated the same, but to
      users the distinction between the two may be important and needs to
      be recorded explicitly.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      In all cases "Active" is the default state, "Inactive" means
      that the relationship has ended, at least temporarily. In each
      case, all the built-in "meanings" must be used in at least one
      Title/Code/Meaning option.
