    You can create the CSV file in a spreadsheet and export it in CSV
    (Comma-Separated Values) format.  The structure of the table is
    described below.
  </p>


  <p i18n:translate="">
    The first row of the file must contain two cells terms in this schoolyear.
    Sections will be created in terms from first to last.
  </p>

  <p i18n:translate="">
    The second row must be empty.  After that,
    several section descriptions may follow.  They are separated by
    an extra carriage return (i.e., a blank line).
  </p>

  <p i18n:translate="">
    Each section description's first row contains the <strong>course
    SchoolTool ID</strong> and the <strong>instructor username</strong> for the new
    section.
  </p>

  <p i18n:translate="">
    If you want to update the sections instead, in section description's first
    row you should specify: <strong>course SchoolTool ID</strong>, <strong>instructor username</strong> and then <strong>section SchoolTool ID</strong> for corresponding sections in each term.  <strong>Note:</strong> if your school has, say, 5 consecutive
    terms and you specify terms "2", "4" in the top of csv, you will need to provide
    3 section ids, for terms "2", "3" and "4" respectively.
  </p>

  <p i18n:translate="">
    Then a number of rows specifying the section schedule
   <strong>may</strong> follow.
   First there's a row containing the <strong>timetable id</strong>.
   Then, several rows containing a <strong>day title</strong> and a
   <strong>period title</strong>, follows.

   Section schedule description is terminated by three asterisks
   ('***') in the first column.
  </p>
  <p i18n:translate="">
    After the terminator, any number of <strong>person
    user names</strong> may follow, the denoted persons will be added to the
    section as learners.
  </p>

  <p i18n:translate="">Example:</p>

<pre class="csv-text" i18n:translate="">
"Fall", "Spring"
"","",""
"philosophy","lorch"
"weekly-timetable"
"Monday","A"
"Monday","B"
"Tuesday","B"
"***"
"johnny"
"billy"
""
"literature","guzman","literature-f","literature-s"
"***"
"johnny"
"pete"
</pre>

  <p i18n:translate="">
    The above example will create sections for philosophy and literature
    lectures.  Sections will be taught from fall term to spring term.
    The section for the philosophy lecture will have persons
    with user names 'johnny' and 'billy' as learners.  It will also
    be scheduled on Monday (two lessons, periods 'A' and 'B') and Tuesday.
    The literature section will be processed in a similar fashion, but
    will have no defined schedule.  The literature SchoolTool IDs will be
    set to literature-f in Fall and literature-s in Spring.
