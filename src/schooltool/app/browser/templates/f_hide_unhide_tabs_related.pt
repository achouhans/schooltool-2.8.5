    <p i18n:translate="">
      Schools that are not using all components of SchoolTool can reduce
      visual clutter by hiding unnecessary links in the top navigation bar.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      Note that these settings have no effects other than removing
      navigational links; they don't change the functionality, data, or
      security settings of SchoolTool in any way.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      Links can be changed from visible to hidden at any time.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      When users log in, they will usually be directed to the tab selected in
      the default column.  The default tab must also be visible.
