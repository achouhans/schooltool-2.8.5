Membership relationship.

This module defines group membership as a relationship.

We also need to register an event subscriber for IBeforeRelationshipEvent,
to enforce relationship constraints.

    >>> import zope.event
    >>> old_subscribers = zope.event.subscribers[:]
    >>> zope.event.subscribers.append(enforceMembershipConstraints)

We will need some sample persons and groups for the demonstration

    >>> from schooltool.group.group import Group
    >>> from schooltool.person.person import Person
    >>> jonas = persons['jonas'] = Person()
    >>> petras = persons['petras'] = Person()
    >>> developers = groups['developers'] = Group()
    >>> admins = groups['admins'] = Group()

You can create memberships this way:

    >>> from schooltool.app.membership import Membership
    >>> Membership(member=jonas, group=developers)
    >>> Membership(member=petras, group=developers)
    >>> Membership(member=petras, group=admins)

You can find all members of a group, or groups of a persons this way:

    >>> from schooltool.relationship import getRelatedObjects
    >>> from schooltool.app.membership import URIMember, URIGroup
    >>> set(getRelatedObjects(developers, URIMember)) == set([jonas, petras])
    True
    >>> set(getRelatedObjects(petras, URIGroup)) == set([admins, developers])
    True

There are some constraints: Only objects providing IGroup can be groups.

    >>> Membership(member=jonas, group=petras)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    InvalidRelationship: Groups must provide IGroup.

You may not create cyclic memberships as support is dropped now for
group-to-group Membership relationships.

    >>> Membership(member=admins, group=developers)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    InvalidRelationship: Groups cannot be members of a group anymore.

You may not create ill-formed relationships

    >>> from schooltool.relationship import relate
    >>> from schooltool.app.membership import URIMembership
    >>> relate(URIMembership, (jonas, URIMember), (petras, URIMember))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    InvalidRelationship: Membership must have one member and one group.

    >>> relate(URIMembership, (jonas, URIGroup), (petras, URIGroup))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    InvalidRelationship: Membership must have one member and one group.

Resources can't be part of a group:

    >>> from schooltool.resource.resource import Resource
    >>> printer = Resource()
    >>> relate(URIMembership, (admins, URIGroup), (printer, URIMember))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    InvalidRelationship: Resources cannot be members of a group.

Of course, these constraints do not apply to other kinds of relationships.

    >>> from schooltool.relationship.tests import URIStub
    >>> relate('example:Frogship', (jonas, URIStub('example:Frog')),
    ...                            (petras, URIStub('example:Frog')))

That's all.
