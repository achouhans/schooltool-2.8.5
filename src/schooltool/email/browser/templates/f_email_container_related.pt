    What is This?

    <p i18n:translate="">
      SchoolTool can send emails through your school email server or
      another SMTP server. That is, SchoolTool is not an email server,
      it sends mail as an email client, like a desktop application
      such as Evolution or Outlook.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      To enable SchoolTool to send emails, you will need the
      instructions from your school's server, your ISP, or your
      webmail provider to configure a mail client to send mail via the
      provider's SMTP service.
