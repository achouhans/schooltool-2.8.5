    The above example will create 4 courses titled 'Ancient
    History', 'US History', 'World History' and 'Spanish'.  The
    first and third courses will have the descriptions
    'Pre-history through 1000 A.D.' and '1000 A.D.  through the
    20th century' respectively.  The second and forth courses
    will have no description. The second, third and forth
    courses will have their SchoolTool IDs set to us-history and
    history-world. The forth course will have its Alternate ID
    set to spanish-gov and its credits value set to 5.

    If you will upload a CSV with titles or course ids that are
    already present in the database, existing courses will be
    updated.

    Course Ids take precedence when determining which course
    should be updated.
